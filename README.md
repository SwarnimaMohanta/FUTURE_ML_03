<h1>ðŸŽ¯BUILD A CHATBOT FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT</h1>
Designed and deployed a Dialogflow-based AI chatbot tailored for customer support, capable of handling diverse user queries through smart intent recognition and contextual conversations. Implemented fallback mechanisms and typo-tolerant responses to enhance user experience and reliability. The chatbot was integrated into a personal portfolio site, with its visual interface meticulously customized using HTML and CSS to match a sleek, dark-themed UI. This project demonstrated the practical application of natural language processing in real-time environments and showcased my ability to blend backend intelligence with frontend aesthetics.<br><br>
